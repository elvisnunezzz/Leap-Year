# Leap Year Calculator

## Project Description
This Java application calculates the total number of leap years between a starting and an ending year provided by the user. It prompts the user to enter both the start year and the end year, then computes and displays the count of all leap years that fall within this range.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure Java is installed on your machine. You can check this by running `java -version` in the command line.
2. Download the source code from the repository or clone it using:
   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/elvisnunezzz/Leap-Year/blob/main/nuneelvi_Program1.java>
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
4. Compile the Java program using:
   ```
   javac LeapYearCalculator.java
   ```
5. Run the compiled Java program:
   ```
   java LeapYearCalculator
   ```

## Usage
- When prompted, enter the starting year and the ending year as integers.
- The program will then calculate and display the total number of leap years within the given range.
- Ensure that the starting year is less than or equal to the ending year.

## Example
```
Please enter the starting year: 2000
Please enter the ending year: 2020
Total leap years between 2000 and 2020: 6
```

This simple utility is useful for educational purposes and as a reference for handling user inputs and performing calculations in Java.
